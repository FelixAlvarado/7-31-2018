what is a tail call recursion? why is it helpful, if at all? 

Tailed recursion is when the recusive call is the last thing executed in the funciton 

Tail recursive funcitons are considered better. can be optimized by compiler. Nothing left to do in funciton after recursive call, so saving stack grame is no use. 

How is memory allocated during recursive funciton calls?

Memory is allocated on the stack. Whenn it reaches the base case, it works its way back down.
